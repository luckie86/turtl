# Turtl

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Challenge:

Let's say you have an empty web page open in your web browser. The width and height of your web browser window can vary. Calculate the biggest square you can fit on the page (position, edge length). Then calculate the next biggest square you can fit without overlapping any other squares that are already on the page. Keep doing this until there is no room left on the page and you have calculated all the squares you can fit on it.

Write at least a few tests that verify your code works.

You don't have to actually draw the squares or even run your code inside a web browser (unless you really want to). You can do the assignment in any programming language. In fact, we suggest you use the one you are most comfortable with.

There are no tricks in this coding assignment. We have solved it ourselves and, though your solution can certainly be better than ours, we believe it shouldn't take more than an hour or two if you're not too ambitious. And you really don't need to be :)
